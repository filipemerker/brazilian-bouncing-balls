# What is this project about?
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· This is a replica of a project developed by me in 2016 for the international brand LOccitane.
My task was to create an interactive brazilian map formed by bouncing balls.

The project was created with VueJS and `Canvas` API to build and animate the map.

You can access the project [clicking here](https://filipemerker.github.io/brazilian-bouncing-balls/) and interact with the map by **filtering on the sidebar** or **clicking on the balls**.
