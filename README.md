# brazillian-bouncing-balls
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Canvas "bouncing balls" animation experiment within an arbitrary shape.

This is a replica of a project made in 2016 for a international brand.
The briefing was to create an interactive brazillian map formed by bouncing balls.

While the original project used vanilla JS, this one was made with VueJS and uses the `canvas` API to build and animate the map.

You can access the project [clicking here](https://filipemerker.github.io/brazillian-bouncing-balls/) and interact with the map by **filtering on the sidebar** or **clicking on the balls**.
