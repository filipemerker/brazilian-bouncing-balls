# What is this project about?
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· This is a replica of a project I developed for LOccitane.

My task was to create an interactive brazilian map formed by bouncing balls.

The project was created with VueJS and `Canvas` API to build and animate the map.

## Live demo

You can interact with the map by **filtering on the sidebar** or **clicking on the balls**.
